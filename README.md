* Business Needs
* EDA
* Model Building in Google Colab using PyCaret
* Experiment Tracking using MLflow
* Configuration Tracking
* Building a web front-end to serve the Model using Streamlit
* Deploying the Streamlit app to Heroku

This was assignment #3 in DPhi Tech's Machine Learning Bootcamp Advanced track. I enrolled in the bootcamp to sharpen the saw for a variety of skills.
Initially I built out a simple ML pipeline using pandas and sklearn and restarted the assignment using PyCaret, informed by the EDA and restricted evaluation
from my simple pipeline. This gave me a greater appreciation for what PyCaret brings to citizen data scientists, ML engineers and Data Scientists.

From my prior experience working with Azure Machine Learning, I have started the initial iteration to build capabilities that a data scientist would need
when working alongside DBA, MLOps and Full-Stack Web Developers in a SCRUM/Product-Centric team in order to capture salient information through the DTAP lifecycle.
